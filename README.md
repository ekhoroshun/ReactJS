# objective

"To work with React and practice working with Component based architecture. We will continue to connect to
our Teams API as a data source for our app."

# specification

For this application, I was working entirely in React. My application has 4 routes: Overview,
Projects, Teams & Employees. Each route is responsible for rendering information from our Teams API
(often in a <table> format)
